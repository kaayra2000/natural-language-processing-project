## What Does It Include

* ChatBot

** chatgui.py

This code snippet is a part of a chatbot that processes user input and returns a predicted response. First, the NLTK library is used to lemmatize the words in the sentence and then a bag of words is created for those words. Then, using the loaded model, the class of the sentence is predicted and the results are returned, as long as they fall below a certain threshold. The class with the highest probability is selected and as a response, an associated response from that class is chosen.
